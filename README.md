# SkiOpremaPhp

Web application for a Ski Shop.
This app provides most basic needs an E-commerce shop needs:
- Login and Register
- Access to certain things w/ login
- Update of personal information afterwards if needed
- Looking through our orders
- Access to cart and preview of items
- Search feature in the shop with price range and type of item
- Admin feature for a user with premission
- Admin can look at all the users,orders,products and messages(will be changed w/ mail server)

The user can purchase and review any item he wants. The items can be purchased in any quantity the user wants via the store page and be previewd in the cart.
Afterwards the user can checkout and buy this products. Currently only option is cash on delivery,but I'm looking to add a paypal sandbox server.

For the making of this application I used:
- Html
- Css
- Bootstrap
- Php
- JavaScript
- MYSql

Things to be added:
- Discount feature.
- More paying options.
- Removing of the message feture as is,and establish a polished and smooth email system.
- Overal fixing some of design issues.
- On single item page,the items below should be of the same kind(ex. if i look at skis,it should only recommend me skis and so on).

Preview:
